# Levels

- [Fallback](#level-one-fallback)
- [Fallout](#level-two-fallout)
- [Coin Flip](#level-three-coin-flip)

## Level One: Fallback

### What to look for:

Functions like receiving and `fallback` and `fallback` which can alter access control

### Resolución:

[Ver código](./test/Fallback.ts)

We observe that the contract has a fallback (receive) function that allows us to become the owner:

```solidity
require(msg.value > 0 && contributions[msg.sender] > 0);
owner = msg.sender;
```

This function is executed when the contract receives ether without call data.
First, we need to execute `contribute` to send some ether without the transaction being reverted.
Next, send ether without call data to trigger the `receive` function and become the owner of the contract.
Finally, execute the withdraw function to `withdraw` the contract balance and leave it at 0.
