This project contains the solutions and explanations for all the current levels of OpenZeppelin's wargame, Ethernaut.

## How to use this repo

Follow these steps to use the repo:

### 1. Install dependencies

First, install all the necessary dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

### 2. Run the desired level

Select the level you want to run and execute the following command, replacing `[levelName].ts` with the desired level's name:

```shell
npx hardhat test ./test/[levelName].ts
```

# Levels

- [Fallback](#level-one-fallback)
- [Fallout](#level-two-fallout)
- [Coin Flip](#level-three-coin-flip)

## Level 1: Fallback

### What to look for:

- Functions like receiving and `fallback` and `fallback` which can alter access control

### Resolution:

[View code](./test/Fallback.ts)

We observe that the contract has a fallback (receive) function that allows us to become the owner:

```solidity
require(msg.value > 0 && contributions[msg.sender] > 0);
owner = msg.sender;
```

This function is executed when the contract receives ether without call data.
First, we need to execute `contribute` to send some ether without the transaction being reverted.
Next, send ether without call data to trigger the `receive` function and become the owner of the contract.
Finally, execute the withdraw function to `withdraw` the contract balance and leave it at 0.

## Level 2: Fallout

### What to look for:

- Spelling mistakes

### Resolution:

[View code](./test/Fallout.ts)

In previous versions of Solidity, to specify the function that is executed when deploying a contract, one with the same name as the contract was used and it functioned as a constructor.
In this case, if we try to view the value of either of the two variables, we quickly see that they are empty:

```solidity
    owner = msg.sender;
    allocations[owner] = msg.value;
```

This is due to a spelling mistake in the constructor function, and its name does not match the Fallout contract vs. Fal1out.

Simply executing Fal1out is enough to make us the owner of the contract and thus complete the level.

## Level Three: Coin Flip
